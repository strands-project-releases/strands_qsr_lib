Moving or Stationary
====================

The *Moving or Stationary* (MOS) QSR is a simple qualitative relation of an object determining whether it is
moving or not with respect to its coordinate frame origin.

Relations

The relations are simply:

* **moving** when the object is found to have changed its position between two given frames,
* **stationary** when the object is found to not have changed its position between two given frames.
