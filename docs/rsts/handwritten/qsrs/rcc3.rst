Region Connection Calculus 3
============================

.. warning::
    RCC3 relations symbols are subject to change in the near future.


The *Region Connection Calculus* (RCC) [1]_ [2]_ is intended to serve for qualitative spatial representation and reasoning.
RCC abstractly describes regions (in Euclidean space, or in a topological space) by their possible relations to
each other.
