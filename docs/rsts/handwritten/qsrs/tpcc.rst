Ternary Point Configuration Calculus
====================================

The Ternary Point Configuration Calculus (TPCC) deals with point-like objects in the 2D-plane.
It is a application based variant of the Double Cross calculus,
allowing finer distinctions of positional information than the calculi presented before.
