ros-indigo-qsr-prob-rep (0.3.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Fixing normalisation of matrix. It only worked because they are square and all entries are 1.
  * Printing debug information on creation of the pf for all models not only for the first two. Might have also killed the server if only one model.
  * Adding all the new arguments of the hmm create message to the example hmm client. Use ... create -h for help.
  * The assumption that every hmm has a start state 0 is not valid. now there is a flag start_at_zero when you want to enforce a start state at 0.
  * generic hmm emi and trans have to numpy arrays to be consistent.
  * Fixing available hmms for help message
  * Adding simple tests for the particle filter
  * Fixing install targets.
  * Adding pybayes as a dependency
  * Adding optional pseudo transitions to hmm.
  * Adding a generic hmm that takes a lookup table, and optionally a transition and emission matrix. If the latter two are not provided, uniform distribution is assumed.
  * Updating readme slightly
  * Adding example files for particle filter creation.
  * Adding helper functions and scripts to create all the files necessary for the particle filter from the HMM or for QTC
  * Adding a particle filter for QRSs
  * 
    
      * Decoupling HMMs from the main library functionality to allow for other representations to be added more easily.
      * The Services are now create by decorating functions using the ServiceManager class.
      * Simplifies the service generation by not needing to maintain a dictionary with all the services.
      * Simplifies the class structure by not calling weird lambda functions anymore.
      * removing qsr_type from the service request and response.
      * Now part of the general kwargs for hmm
      * Particle filter will not use this
      * Allows to have a generic hmm that takes trans and emi matrix plus a lookup instead of a specific implementation.
    
  * Renamed example ros client to example hmm client as every representation will have their own client.
  * Introducing namespaces for services to distinguish between hmm and other representations.

ros-indigo-qsr-prob-rep (0.1.2-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Adding RCC3 as an easy example on how to add new QSRs to the prob rep lib.
    Also, updating README.
  * Removing rubbish from test file.
  * Updated documentation to reflect name changes.
  * Cleaning up cmake and package file, adding qsr_prob_rep to meta package
  * Adding tests for creation, sampling and loglikelihood of all three qtc types.
  * Finally enabling qtcbc and minor changes
    * qtcbc now works using code from qtcb and qtcc and some custom functions overwriting the ones in qtc_hmm_abstractclass
    * Removed some prints and fixed comments.
  * Fixing a bug where the final state was always 82... d'oh
  * Renaming package
